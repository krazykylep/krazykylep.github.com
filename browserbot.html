<h1>BrowserBot</h1>
This is the documentation page for the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/110336">BrowserBot</a> GreaseMonkey script. A fair warning: BrowserBot requires you to know a little about HTML and some features require that you know JavaScript. This guide will only cover the very basics on how to use BrowserBot. Sorry about this being bad documentation. I don't really expect anyone to want to use this who cant kind of figure it out on their own.

Step Set: It holds all your programmed steps for the browser to follow.<br/>
Step: This is something your browser will do for you.<br/>
<br/>
On the left side, you can name your step set and save it under that name. You can also add steps from the left side. There are 10 different steps:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Check Content</li>
<li>Goto Step</li>
<li>Set Content</li>
<li>Set URL</li>
<li>Wait</li>
<li>Trigger Event</li>
<li>Notify</li>
<li>GV SMS</li>
<li>Run Code</li>
<li>Stop</li>
</ul>

Everytime you see "Jquery Selector" it's talking about the element on the page you want to look at. Here is the API: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/">http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/</a>. Use your browser's view sorce to see what you want to select. You could also use <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">firebug</a> to find the element you want to look at. Use "#something" to get the element with id="something". Use ".something" to find the element with classname something. If you provide a selector that matches multiple elements for the check content step, it will only use the first one. The Trigger Event step will allow you to do just that - trigger an event. Use "click" in the JS event box to emulate a click on a button (like in a log in form). The Run Code step lets you run arbitrary JavaScript - be careful using it, as it uses the eval function. You can also modify the step number in a run code step. Just set current_step = 3 to skip to step 4. Yes, you have to set it to the step you want to go to minus one because current_step is always incremented after every step. I'm not sure if the GV SMS step works every time... I tested it once and it worked for me.
<br/><br/>Here is an example step set. It uses this page to play around with: <a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl">http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl</a><br/>
