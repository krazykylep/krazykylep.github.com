<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>My name is Kyle Paulsen. I love to play games, eat snacks, and listen to chip tune music, but most importantly, I love to write software.</p>
<h3><a href="kyle_paulsen_resume.pdf">Click here to view my resume.</a></h3>
<p>I have a dropbox folder with tons of random programming projects and those are only the projects I remembered to upload! Most of my work is centered around using web technologies. Below are some of the projects I'm more proud of.</p>
<h2>Island Fever</h2>
<img alt="Island Fever" class="projectImage right" src="img/islandfever.jpg">
<p>Island Fever is the start of a three.js, voxel-based, island game. Here are some of the sweet features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Diverse, procedurally generated 3D islands that are waiting to be explored.</li>
    <li>A save/load/delete system for re-visiting a island that you already generated. It uses IndexedDB!</li>
    <li>It works on mobile too! (May take a while to load an island).</li>
</ul>
<p>I've always wanted to start coding some sort of three.js game that could also run in a mobile browser (specifically chrome for mobile). I tried hard to keep the code clean and fast with a sweet development environment.</p>
