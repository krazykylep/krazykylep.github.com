        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>My name is Kyle Paulsen. I love to play games, and listen to chip tune music. But most importantly, I love to write software.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Portland State University in my hometown of Portland, Oregon with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. The types of projects that I enjoy working on in my free time are mostly web and graphics related. I like exploring new technologies and I always have an eye out for what is developing in my field. Below are some of the projects I'm more proud of.</p>

        <p>Island Fever is the start of a three.js, voxel-based, island game. Here are some of the sweet features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diverse, procedurally generated 3D islands that are waiting to be explored.</li>
            <li>A save/load/delete system for re-visiting a island that you already generated. It uses IndexedDB!</li>
            <li>It works on mobile too! (May take a while to load an island).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've always wanted to start coding some sort of three.js game that could also run in a mobile browser (specifically chrome for mobile). I tried hard to keep the code clean and fast with a sweet development environment.</p>
