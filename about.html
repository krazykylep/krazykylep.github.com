    My name is Kyle Paulsen and I recently graduated from Portland State University in my hometown of Portland, Oregon with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. The types of projects that I enjoy working on in my free time are mostly web and graphics related. I like exploring new technologies and I always have an eye out for what is developing in my field. My interest in Computer Science began when I was young and my older brothers encouraged me to learn html. The most satisfying part of programming for me is seeing the code Iâ€™ve built transform into a working application.
